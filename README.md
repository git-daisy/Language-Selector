#### Creator : git-daisy

* JavaScript 
* JQuery 


## Description : 

 This is now a refactoring project which started out very sloppy and linear. It is simply a survey style webpage that asks you to answer questions to eventually be given a suggested code language to learn. I implemented functions to accomplish more with less effort, and ultimately allowed the program to make the decision based off of the users final input- instead of gathering data from each input. This was a great project to jump back into and wrap my brain around again, it pushed me to get better 'googling' and correctly search for resources. There are still a few things I would love to implement, though it looks and runs much more elequently than before, its not pretty and could use a bit of good styling. Overall I feel happy with what I have accomplished and learned during the refactoring proccess. Now I know some tips and tricks, as well as some things to avoid. (like reading my old readme so I know the epicodus links do not work...  smh) 

## Known Bugs:
 Links to epicodus do not actually work! 
 

## Roadmap:
* Implement Branching 
* Add Images
* Fix links to Epicodus
* Include better descriptions for each language the project references
* Add gh-pages link
