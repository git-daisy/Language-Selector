# optionsProject
A project for my JavaScript review 
# Take the options quiz! 
#### A work in progress webpage dedicated to helping the user find what language they might like to learn! 
#### Creator : git-daisy

## Technologies Used :
* HTML  
* CSS 
* Visual Studio Code 
* Github
* Terminal 
* JavaScript 
* JQuery 


## Description :
This project site is to demonstrate my new skills with JavaScript and JQuery! Upon opening the page you'll find a language 'picker', which will guide a user through multiple questions to reach a final suggestion. I struggled a bit to get my branching to work properly, so decided to save part of my project for another night and comment out some lines I'd like to come back to. Overall I feel good about what I got accomplished with the time I had, and am ecited to finish it up!

## Known Bugs:
 Links to epicodus do not actually work! 
 

## Roadmap:
* Implement Branching 
* Add Images
* Fix links to Epicodus
* Include better descriptions for each language the project references
* Add gh-pages link
